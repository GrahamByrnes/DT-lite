              This module is able to automatically detect and eliminate hotpixels. Hotpixels are
              pixels which failed to record light level correctly. Detected hotpixels are
              replaced by an average value of their neighbors.

    <title>Usage</title>

    <para>
      You control the detection sensitivity with the threshold parameter and the level of
      elimination with the strength parameter.
    </para>

    <sect5>
      <title>threshold</title>
      <para>
        The threshold of the detection, i.e. how strong a pixel's value needs to deviate from
        its neighbors to be regarded as a hotpixel.
      </para>
    </sect5>

    <sect5>
      <title>strength</title>
      <para>
        The strength of blending hotpixels with their surrounding.
      </para>
    </sect5>

    <sect5>
      <title>detect by 3 neighbours</title>
      <para>
        This will extend the detection of hotpixels, it will even regard a pixel as hot if a
        minimum of only three (instead of four) neighbor pixels deviate by more than the
        threshold level.
      </para>
    </sect5>

    <sect5>
      <title>mark fixed pixels</title>
      <para>
        This options will mark the pixels that have been corrected. It also displays the count
        of detected and fixed pixels.
      </para>
