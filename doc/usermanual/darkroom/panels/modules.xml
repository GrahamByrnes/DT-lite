            More modules at the bottom of the right panel is used to show the less frequently
            used modules. By default only standard modules are shown to the user but you can use
            this function to make the extra modules visible, or alternatively to hide away
            modules you don't typically use.

  <para>
    Each module is shown with a small icon next to its name. Left-click with your mouse to
    toggle the status between visible, hidden and favorite. Favorite modules are indicated by a
    star in front of the icon and in addition to appearing in their normal module group will
    also be visible in the module group
    <link linkend="module_groups"><emphasis>favorites</emphasis></link>. This is a good way to
    get fast access to modules that you use very frequently. Visible modules are indicated in
    the list by a light grey background whilst hidden modules have a dark grey background and do
    not display any of their controls.
  </para>

  <para>
    Hiding or un-hiding modules is not meant to be part of your daily workflow, you should only
    occasionally need to review the modules you typically use. However, you may store various
    settings at your choice as presets for later reuse.
