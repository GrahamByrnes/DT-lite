This directory contains tools to automatically generate the lua API documentation.

The documentation is generated by introspecting the lua API from within DT then
adding the documentation from the file "content.lua" and making sure everything
is documented.

USAGE

to regenerate the documentation you must first add the tools to your lua path
* either copy all the lua files from this directory into <configdir>/lua
* or add this directory to lua's search path using the following code

	package.path = package.path..";/home/rosen/perso/darktable/darktable/tools/lua_doc/?.lua"

once the lua documentation is in your path you need to require the correct file
	
	wiki = require "wiki"
or
	usermanual = require "usermanual"

and last you need to print the doc. To print to stdout simply run the following

	print (wiki.get_doc())

or 
	outfile =io.open("/home/rosen/perso/darktable/darktable/doc/usermanual/lua/lua_api.xml","w+")
	outfile:write(usermanual.get_doc())
	outfile:close()

If you want to exit darktable immediately, you can use the following

	os.exit()
